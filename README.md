# Stock-Market-Crash-Prediction-Using-AI-ML

  Stock price prediction by using Machine Learning. Machine learning has 
significant applications in the stock price prediction. In this machine learning 
project, we will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This is a very 
complex task and has uncertainties. We will develop this project into two parts:

  1. First, we will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural 
network.
  2. Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.

LSTM MODEL:
  One of the most advanced models out there to forecast time series is 
the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network. According to 
Dr.Korstanje in his book, Advanced Forecasting with Python: “The LSTM cell 
adds long-term memory in an even more performant way because it allows even 
more parameters to be learned.

PLOTY DASH:
  Plotly offers open-source and enterprise products. Dash is an open-source 
Python, R, and Julia framework for building web-based analytic applications. 
Many specialized open-source Dash libraries exist that are tailored for building 
domain-specific Dash components and applications.

1.1 OVERVIEW
    Predicting extreme events out-of-sample early and accurately, i.e., predicting 
all financial crises which actually happened without crying wolf, is notoriously 
difficult. As Fouliard, Howell, and Rey (2021) note, the ability of existing early
warning models to predict turning points or nonlinear and inateractive 
phenomena out-of-sample is still limited. The most prominent examples of 
extreme events that occur infrequently and irregularly are banking crises, 
sovereign debt crises, private debt crises, and currency crises (Kaminsky and 
Reinhart, 1999; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2011; Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2017; 
Baron, Verner, and Xiong, 2021). Such rare and far between crisis events, causing 
substantial economic, social, and political costs, are obviously a source of 
constant concern. For example, Laeven and Valencia (2020) document that the 
average cumulative output loss in a banking crisis (computed as deviations of 
actual GDP from its trend) is around 20% over the length of the crisis, which is, 
on average, two years.

1.2 OBJECTIVE
   The main motive of creating this algorithm is to show way to earn something 
from investing in stock market via trading. Most of the youngsters is running out 
of money and motivation. Here this algorithm, predict the previous years stock 
price of respective industry and comparing the closure price mean, median and
mode, So that it will visualize the prediction graph for better understand. We 
concluding that, this algorithm make every youngsters to invest at 99.9% risk 
free.

1.3 EXISTING SOLUTION
  For over a decade, The investors use their experience and analyse knowledge
to predict the market trend, and the past is organised in a structure and that reason 
major stock market fall happens rarely, But now anything can happen at any time
and the investing is carried out with Brokerage fees.

1.4 PROPOSED SOLUTION
  The Stock market prediction algorithm works by visualizing and analysing the 
past 10 years dataset till the current set where the modules could be High starting 
rate, Closing rate, Low staring rate, Market capacity and time interval. Here, the 
user need to search for Stocks and they will be resulted with Visualization graphs.
